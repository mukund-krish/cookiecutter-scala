# Scala Cookiecutter template #

A cookiecutter template for generating SBT projects.

## How to use? ##


* Install cookiecutter globally. (you will need python pip installed)

```bash
$> sudo pip install cookiecutter
```

* Install git if you don't have it

```shell
$> sudo apt-get install git
```

* Create a barebone sbt/scala project using cookiecutter

```shell
$> cookiecutter gh:mukund-krish/cookiecutter-scala
```

  cookiecutter will prompt you for name, version etc. Fill these up. At the end of this process
  you should have a simple scala+sbt project
